"""SageAttention kernel probe (CONTRACTS.md section 8).

A REAL kernel launch, because import success is not evidence: the old baked
wheel imports fine on an H100 and then cannot launch. Extracted from the
heredoc duplicated at comfyui-wan/src/start.sh:26-34 and
comfyui-minimax/src/start.sh:36-44.

Invocation (no arguments):

    python3 /opt/comfyui-runtime/src/sage_probe.py

Exit codes / stdout (exactly one line, D9 wording):
    0  kernel launch succeeded     "SageAttention probe passed on sm<XX>"
    1  supported arch, probe raised
       (import error, launch failure, no CUDA device, unreadable capability)
                                   "SageAttention probe failed on sm<XX>,
                                    launching without it, report this"
    2  arch not in the dispatch set
                                   "unsupported GPU arch sm<XX>, SageAttention off"

The arch check runs BEFORE importing sageattention, so exit 2 is reachable
even when the wheel is absent or broken.
