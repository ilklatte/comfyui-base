"""Unified manifest-driven model download manager.

Reads a manifest of `<url>\\t<abs_dest>[\\t<min_size_mb>]` lines (CONTRACTS.md
section 1), downloads each entry with a thread pool of 3 and a single snapshot
logger that prints an append-only status block every 10 seconds (non-TTY safe,
no carriage-return progress bars).

Per-URL routing, so nothing is ever silently dropped:
- an HF resolve URL goes through hf_hub_download (with hf_xet acceleration),
- a Google Drive URL goes through gdown,
- anything else goes through aria2c.

Every download is staged off the destination volume (local disk when it has
room). NVMe-first: a locally staged model is published at its volume path as a
SYMLINK into the stage, so ComfyUI can load it immediately and the boot never
waits for bytes to cross the network volume. `volume_sync.py` runs detached,
after the launch, and turns each link into a real file. When there was no room
locally the file staged on the volume already, and the rename is instant.

Either way the publish goes through `<dest>.partial` + os.replace, so a partial
file is never visible at the path a workflow loads from.
